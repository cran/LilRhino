Title: For Implementation of Feed Reduction, Learning Examples, NLP and
        Code Management
Version: 1.2.1
Author: Travis Barton (2018) 
Maintainer: Travis Barton <tbarton@csumb.edu>
Description: This is for code management functions, NLP tools, a Monty Hall simulator, and for implementing my own variable reduction technique called Feed Reduction. The Feed Reduction technique is not yet published, but is merely a tool for implementing a series of binary neural networks meant for reducing data into N dimensions, where N is the number of possible values of the response variable.
